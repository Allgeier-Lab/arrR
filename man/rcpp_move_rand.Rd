\description{
Rcpp simulate random/attracted movement.
}
\details{
Simulate movemnt of indivudals eiter either random (\code{reef_attraction = FALSE})
or attracted towards the artifical reef cells (\code{reef_attraction = TRUE}).

In the case of random movement, each timestep a random movement distance
is drawn from a lognorm distribution and the individal moves into a random heading
direction drawn from an uniform distribution.

In the case of attracted movement, fish individuals are aware of the distance to
the closest reef cell in three directions ahead of them (-45, 0, 45 degree) and
always swim in the direction of the shortest distance to a reef cell.

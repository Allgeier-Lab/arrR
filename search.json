Movement can random, attracted towards AR cells based fish characteristics. moved distance iterations used calculate activity individuals. information movement, please see vignette(\"movement-behaviors\"). Uses torus translation boundary simulation environment. 4. Fish respiration: bioenergetics model used simulate respiration fish individuals based body size movement activity. , homogeneous water temperature throughout simulation environment assumed. 5. Fish growth, consumption excretion: Fish individual growth simulated using Bertalanffy growth curve (Froese Pauly, 2019). Length growth converted body mass individuals need consume required nutrients follow growth curve including respiration. amount consumed detrital biomass. detrital biomass smaller required consumption amount individuals, mortality takes place. Lastly, fish individuals excrete non-required consumption nutrients pool. 6. Fish (background) mortality: Simulates background mortality fish individuals based body size. mortality probability increases increasing body size. mortality events increase (fish) detrital biomass. 7. Nutrients detritus diffusion: Simulates diffusion detritus biomass water-column nutrients across neighboring cells. Nutrients output: Simulates certain fraction water column nutrients lost cell timestep. simulated corresponding parameter set zero.","code":""},{"path":"https://allgeier-lab.github.io/arrR/articles/general-background.html","id":"references","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Processes","what":"References","title":"General Background","text":"DeAngelis, D.L., 1992.

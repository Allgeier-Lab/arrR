We try to maintain a list of publications that have used the *arrR* package. If you have used *arrR* in your own work, we would love to hear from you. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/Allgeier-Lab/arrR/issues) on GitHub so we can add your work to this list or contact us via [e-mail](mailto:mhk.hesselbarth@gmail.com). 

To cite *arrR* in a publication or acknowledge its use, please use the following temporary citation
information, substituting 'v0.0' with the version of the package that you used:

*Esquivel, K.E., Hesselbarth, M.H.K., Allgeier, J.E. Mechanistic support for increased primary production around artificial reefs. Manuscript submitted for publication. v0.0*

To get a BibTex entry, please use `citation("arrR")`.
